It's unusual to have a top-level TODO like this, but:

We currently have two versions of SBJSON in Titanium (one for FB support, one for our internals).  Because we've modified
SBJSON so heavily on our side, porting the new SBJSON to our framework is NONTRIVIAL.

This file indicates a massive TODO for porting relevant changes from old SBJSON to the new SBJSON
architecture so that we can remove oldschool SBJSON once and for all.  This could also potentially
resolve innumerable symbol conflicts when compiling modules.
